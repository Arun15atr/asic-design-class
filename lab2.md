### objective
1.Debugging the main function using spark simulation and observing the register values
2.Generating the Object dump file and verify the output with gcc output from lab 1.
## software tools
1.GCC
2.RISCV GNU Compiler
3.Ubuntu
4.Spike Riscv simulator
## Procedure
# STEP1:Compile the code using gcc compiler with the help of following comands
```
gcc sum1ton.c
./a.out
```
# STEP2 : Now compile the same code using risv compiler with the help of following commands
```
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -Ofast -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum1ton.o sum1ton.c
spike pk sum1ton.o
```
# STEP3 : Now invoke the object dump using the following commands you can see the assembly ocde and register
```
riscv64-unkown-elf-objdump -d sum1ton.o | less
```

# STEP4 : Now you will be able to run the codde until which ever line you want using the following commands and you can observe the chnage in values of registers using the following commands
```
until PC 0 100b0
reg 0 a0
reg 0 sp
```
